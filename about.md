I'm currently a senior majoring in computer science and engineering at Dartmouth College, in Hanover, NH. I have a strong passion for video games, problem solving, and creative expression, so it's been my goal for the past 8 years to be a game programmer. Despite not yet having much experience developing games, my knack for learning and creative drive have helped me pick up a menagerie of programming skills, many of which can be leveraged for game development. If you want to learn more these skills specifically, check out my [résumé](/assets/about/Baker_Zeke_Resume.pdf)!

## Some fun facts about me, in no particular order:
* In the photo above, I'm standing in front of Dartmouth's **Baker** Library (no relation).
* My full degree title is "Bachelor of the Arts with a Computer Science modified with Engineering Sciences Major and a Hispanic Studies Minor".
* As a Hispanic Studies minor, I like to learn and practice Spanish, which led me to study abroad twice my junior year.
* I love to sing, both choral and a cappella. At college, I'm a member of the Glee Club and the music director of the Brovertones a cappella group.
* I love everything Star Wars (yes, including the sequel trilogy). I hope for one of my first two tattoos to be Star Wars related.
* I'm fascinated with polyhedra, especially those related to *φ*, the golden ratio. I hope for the other of my first two tattoos to be related to this.
* I'm a big fan of twisty puzzles (the family of puzzles to which the Rubik's Cube belongs).

## Some of my favorite video games, in order of what I've played most recently:
* *Red Dead Redemption 2*
* *Minecraft*
* *Call of Duty: Black Ops*
* *Halo Reach*
* *Fallout 4*
* *Saints Row 2*
