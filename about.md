I'm a 2020 graduate from Dartmouth College, with a major in computer science and engineering. I've recntly been hired at Rockstar New England as an Associate AI Programmer, which I'm both incredibly excited and thankful for. Doing something in game development has been a dream of mine for almost a decade now; it's quite special to finally have this opportunity, especially for a company whose games I truly enjoy. If you want to learn more about my skills and professional background, check out my [resume](/assets/about/ZekeBaker_Resume.pdf)!

## Some fun facts about me, in no particular order

* In the photo above, I'm standing in front of Dartmouth's **Baker** Library (no relation).
* I love to sing, both choral and a cappella. At college, I was a member of the Glee Club and the music director of the Brovertones a cappella group.
* I love everything Star Wars (yes, including the sequel trilogy). I hope for one of my first two tattoos to be Star Wars related.
* I'm fascinated with polyhedra, especially those related to *Ï†*, the golden ratio. I hope for the other of my first two tattoos to be related to this.
* I'm a big fan of twisty puzzles (the family of puzzles to which the Rubik's Cube belongs).
* My full degree title is "Bachelor of the Arts with a Computer Science modified with Engineering Sciences Major and a Hispanic Studies Minor".
* To help immerse myself in the language and some of the cultures learned about for my minor, I studied abroad twice my junior year.

## Some of my favorite video games, in order of what I've played most recently

* *Minecraft*
* *Red Dead Redemption 2*
* *Call of Duty: Black Ops*
* *Halo Reach*
* *Fallout 4*

## A brief history of "ClydeHobart"

Around 2010, a friend and I were theorizing about a hypothetical situation where Justin Bieber had changed his name to "Justin Bieber" to aid his rise to stardom, and we were brainstorming some potential birth names, and "Clyde Hobart" was suggested. I latched on to the name, not for any particular affinity to Justin Bieber, but just since tweens are always looking for a "cool" new pseudonym/alias/username in this digital age that we live in. Thus, ClydeHobart was born. Aside from being my GitHub username (hence "clydehobart.github.io", the GitHub Pages home for this site), it's also my username for a grand plethora of sites/apps/games.
