I'm currently a senior majoring in computer science and engineering at Dartmouth College, in Hanover, NH. I have a strong passion for video games, problem solving, and creative expression, so it's been my goal for the past 8 years to be a game programmer. My knack for learning and creative drive have helped me pick up a menagerie of programming skills, many of which can be leveraged for game development. If you want to learn more these skills specifically, check out my [resume](/assets/about/Baker_Zeke_Resume.pdf)!

## Some fun facts about me, in no particular order:
* In the photo above, I'm standing in front of Dartmouth's **Baker** Library (no relation).
* My full degree title is "Bachelor of the Arts with a Computer Science modified with Engineering Sciences Major and a Hispanic Studies Minor".
* As a Hispanic Studies minor, I like to learn and practice Spanish, which led me to study abroad twice my junior year.
* I love to sing, both choral and a cappella. At college, I'm a member of the Glee Club and the music director of the Brovertones a cappella group.
* I love everything Star Wars (yes, including the sequel trilogy). I hope for one of my first two tattoos to be Star Wars related.
* I'm fascinated with polyhedra, especially those related to *Ï†*, the golden ratio. I hope for the other of my first two tattoos to be related to this.
* I'm a big fan of twisty puzzles (the family of puzzles to which the Rubik's Cube belongs).

## Some of my favorite video games, in order of what I've played most recently:
* *Red Dead Redemption 2*
* *Minecraft*
* *Call of Duty: Black Ops*
* *Halo Reach*
* *Fallout 4*
* *Saints Row 2*

## A brief history of "ClydeHobart"
Around 2010, a friend and I were theorizing about a hypothetical situation where Justin Bieber had changed his name to "Justin Bieber" to aid his rise to stardom, and we were brainstorming some potential birth names, and "Clyde Hobart" was suggested. I latched on to the name, not for any particular affinity to Justin Bieber, but just since tweens are always looking for a "cool" new pseudonym/alias/username in this digital age that we live in, and thus ClydeHobart was born. Aside from being my GitHub username (hence "clydehobart.github.io"), it's also my username for a grand plethora of sites/apps/games.
