This is a GitHub Pages site that I, Zeke Baker, use as a portfolio of some of my projects. I'm not a big web dev guy, so I started this off using the template at the website for this theme, [Cayman Blog Theme](https://lorepirri.github.io/cayman-blog/). The only content on this repo that's mine is the content for my posts and the content mentioned therein.
