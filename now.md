COVID-19 quarantine feels pretty normalized now, strangely enough. I'm living back home in Wisconsin with my mom, but hopefully I'll be moving to the Andover, Massachusetts area some time in November or December, so that I'm ready to resume on-site work for my new job at Rockstar New England! My first day is tomorrow, so if somehow you come across this today, 2020-08-02, wish me luck! In my free time, since my Xbox One is still stuck at Dartmouth, I've been enjoying the 1.16 Nether Update for Minecraft and video chatting with friends.
