I'm currently in my second-last quarter of my undergraduate program at Dartmouth College, taking a [course on computer architecture](http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Computer-Science/COSC-Computer-Science-Undergraduate/COSC-51) and the first of two courses which constitute [my culminating experience](http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Computer-Science/COSC-Computer-Science-Undergraduate/COSC-98-01) as a computer science major. For this culminating experience, my team is working on an asymmetrical 2-player, spy-themed VR & AR game, title TBD.

Aside from spending my spare time applying for jobs, I'm also a member of the Glee Club, which rehearses for a few hours every week. We have a small concert in mid-February, and then a large one with the Dartmouth Symphony Orchestra and Handel Society in late May. I'm currently the Music Director of my a cappella group, the Dartmouth Brovertones, which is a huge source of entertainment in my life.

Nothing's completely official yet, but it currently seems that I'm going to be in Cusco, Peru, for 10 weeks this fall as the Director's Assistant on a [Dartmouth Language Study Abroad Plus Program](https://guarini.dartmouth.edu/programs/spanish-lsa-cuzco), which is super exciting!
