As a resident of Malden, Massachusetts for over a year now, I now live close enough to commute to the office should I need to. That said, I am still working from home (for the time being), which is something I am quite thankful for. Outside of work, I have been participating in an a post-collegiate *a cappella* group, playing through the single-player story of *Grand Theft Auto V*, and trying my best to appreciate the autumnal wonder of New England with my girlfriend.
